      <h1>This is <em>still</em> a bleeping website.</h1>

        And it's more bleeping perfect than <a href="index.html">the last guy's.</a>

    <h2>Seriously, it takes minimal effort to improve this garbage.</h2>
    <p><strong>7 freaking declarations.</strong></p>
    <p>That's how much CSS it took to turn that <a href=
        "http://motherfuckingwebsite.com/">grotesque piece of trash</a> into this
      easy-to-read masterpiece. It's so simple and it <em>still</em> has
      all the glory of the original oh-I'm-so-perfect website:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>It's <em>still</em> lightweight and loads fast</li>
      <li><em>Still</em> fits on all your stupid screens</li>
      <li><em>Still</em> looks the same in all your stupid browsers</li>
      <li>The stupid thing's <em>still</em> accessible to every schmuck that
        visits your site</li>
      <li>It's <em>still</em> legible and gets your stupid point
        across</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>And guess what, moron:</h3>
    <p>You never knew it, but it's easy to improve readability on your site.
      Here's how.</p>
    <h2>Let it breathe</h2>
    <p>Look at lines 1 and 2 of some website you're building. Assuming
      they're not married they probably shouldn't be humping. The defaults are
      trash -- pick a minimum <code>line-height: 1.4</code> for body copy.
      Headings should be tighter. If you can't see that...get out.</p>
    <p>If your text hits the side of the browser, just go away forever. You ever
      see a book like that? Yes? What an awful book.</p>
    <h2>A little less contrast</h2>
    <p>Black on white? How often do you see that kind of contrast in real life?
      Tone it down a bit, Picasso. I would've even made this site's background a
      nice <code>#EEEEEE</code> if I wasn't so focused on keeping declarations to
      a lean 7 bleeping lines.</p>
    <h2>Size Matters</h2>
    <p>I know your partner says otherwise, but it's true. Bump that body copy
      to render close to 16px or more. Smaller type works well for print, not the
      screen.</p>
    <h2>Line-width, Leonardo</h2>
    <p>Looking at an LCD screen is strainful enough. Don't make me read a line
      of text that's 200 freaking characters long. Keep it to a nice 60-80 and
      users might actually read more than one sentence of your worthless
      dribble.</p>
    <h3>Yes, this is <em>also</em> satire, you imbecile</h3>
    <p>I love what the creator of <a href=
        "index.html">this site's inspiration</a> did. What
      I'm saying is that it's so, so simple to make sites easier to read.
      Websites are broken by default, they are functional, high-performing, and
      accessible, but they're also really ugly. You and all the other web
      designers out there need to make them not total garbage.</p>
