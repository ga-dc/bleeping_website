      <aside>And it's bleeping perfect.</aside>

    <h2>Seriously, what else do you want?</h2>

    <p>You probably build websites and think your stuff is special. You think your 13 megabyte parallax-ative home page is going to get you some fancy Awwward banner you can glue to the top corner of your site. You think your 40-pound jQuery file and 83 polyfills give IE7 a hot flash because it finally has box-shadow. Wrong, genius. Let me describe your perfect website:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>It's lightweight and loads fast</li>
      <li>Fits on all your stupid screens</li>
      <li>Looks the same in all your stupid browsers</li>
      <li>The stupid thing's accessible to every schmuck that visits your site</li>
      <li>It's legible and gets your stupid point across (if you had one instead of just 5mb pics of hipsters drinking coffee)</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Well guess what, moron:</h3>

    <p>You. Are. Over-designing. Look at this thing. It's a freaking website. Why do you need to animate a trendy banner flag when I hover over that useless piece of trash? You spent hours on it and added 80 kilobytes to your dumb site, and some jerk jabbing at it on their iPad with fat sausage fingers will never see that. Not to mention blind people will never see it, but they don't see any of your stupid stuff.</p>

    <p>You never knew it, but this is your perfect website. Here's why.</p>

    <h2>It's lightweight</h2>

    <p>This entire page weighs less than the gradient-meshed Facebook logo on your awful Wordpress site. Did you seriously load 100kb of jQuery UI just so you could animate the bleeping background color of a div? You loaded all 7 fontfaces of an ugly webfont just so you could say "Hi." at 100px height at the beginning of your site? You idiot.</p>

    <h2>It's responsive</h2>

    <p>You bonehead. You thought you needed media queries to be responsive, but no. Responsive means that it responds to whatever screensize it's viewed on. This site doesn't care if you're on an iMac or a freaking Tamagotchi.</p>

    <h2>It works</h2>

    <p>Look at this garbage. You can read it ... that is, if you can read. It makes sense. It has hierarchy. It's using HTML5 tags so you and your lame browser know what the heck's in this stupid site. That's semantics, Einstein.</p>

    <p>It has content on the bleeping screen. Your site has three bylines and link to your dribbble account, but you spread it over 7 full screens and make me click some bobbing button to show me how cool the jQuery ScrollTo plugin is.</p>

    <p>Cross-browser compatibility? Load this in IE6. I dare you.</p>

    <h2>This is a website. Look at it. You've never seen one before.</h2>

    <p>Like the man who's never grown out his beard has no idea what his true natural state is, you have no clue what a website is. All you have ever seen are crappy skeuomorphic bastardizations of what should be text communicating a message. This is a real, naked website. Look at it. It's bleeping beautiful.</p>

    <h3>Yes, this is satire, you imbecile</h3>

    <p>I'm not actually saying your stupid site should look like this. What I'm saying is that all the problems we have with websites are <strong>ones we create ourselves</strong>. Websites aren't broken by default, they are functional, high-performing, and accessible. You break them. You dolt.</p>
